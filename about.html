        My goal is to help organizations turn data into actionable insight that
        directly improves player development and drives smarter on-field decisions,
        ultimately contributing to winning a World Series championship.

      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hello — my name is Matthew Lang. I am eager to contribute to an MLB
        organization’s player development efforts by combining my technical
        background, on-field baseball experience, and lifelong passion for improving
        the game through innovation. My primary interests lie in baseball strategy,
        including run creation, run prevention, and player personnel decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        I graduated from Ohio University in 2022 with a 4.0 GPA, majoring in Computer
        Science Engineering. During that time, I also played collegiate baseball for
        one of the nation’s top NCBA programs, making starts in center field,
        shortstop, and on the mound. In parallel, I have spent several years training
        and coaching at Strike Zone, an indoor baseball facility operated by former
        MLB shortstop Carlos Rodriguez. Through that experience, I developed a strong
        foundation in player development, practice design, and video-based instruction.

      <p>
        Professionally, I currently work as a Software Site Reliability Engineer at
        Highmark Health, where I design and maintain large-scale systems supporting
        enterprise reliability and performance. My role requires analytical
        problem-solving, pattern recognition, and the development of tools and visual
        models that support high-stakes decision-making. These experiences have
        strengthened my skills in analytics, software design, and applied
        problem-solving capabilities. I am eager to bring this skill set into a
        baseball operations and player development environment.
      </p>

      <div class="clear"></div>

      <p>
        Technically, I am highly proficient in Python, SQL, R, C++, HTML/CSS, and
        JavaScript, with extensive experience in data visualization and performance
        analysis. I also have hands-on experience applying machine learning techniques
        such as k-means clustering, network centrality, and anomaly detection. Just as
        importantly, I bring a coach’s mindset, an engineer’s discipline, and a deep
        respect for the game—focused on helping players and staff make better,
        data-informed decisions.
