      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello — my name is Matthew Lang. I am eager to contribute to an MLB organization’s player
        development efforts by combining my technical background, on-field baseball experience,
        and lifelong passion for improving the game through innovation. My primary interests lie
        in baseball strategy, including run creation, run prevention, and player personnel
        decision-making.

        <h2>Baseball & Development Background</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated from Ohio University in 2022 with a 4.0 GPA, majoring in Computer Science
          Engineering. During that time, I also played collegiate baseball for one of the nation’s
          top NCBA programs, making starts in center field, shortstop, and on the mound.
        </p>
        <p>
          In parallel, I have spent several years training and coaching at Strike Zone, an indoor
          baseball facility operated by former MLB shortstop Carlos Rodriguez. Through that
          experience, I developed a strong foundation in player development, practice design, and
          video-based instruction.

        <h2>Engineering & Analytics Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I currently work as a Software Site Reliability Engineer at Highmark Health, where I
          design and maintain large-scale systems supporting enterprise reliability and
          performance. My role requires analytical problem-solving, pattern recognition, and the
          development of tools and visual models that support high-stakes decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          These experiences have strengthened my skills in analytics, software design, and
          applied problem-solving—capabilities I am eager to bring into a baseball operations and
          player development environment.

      <h2>Technical Skill Set</h2>
      <p>
        I am highly proficient in Python, SQL, R, C++, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, with extensive
        experience in data visualization and performance analysis. I also have hands-on
        experience applying machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering, network
        centrality, and anomaly detection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as importantly, I bring a coach’s mindset, an engineer’s discipline, and a deep
        respect for the game—focused on helping players and staff make better, data-informed
        decisions.
