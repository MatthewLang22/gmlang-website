      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello — my name is Matthew Lang. I am eager to contribute to an MLB organization’s player development efforts by combining my technical background, on-field baseball experience, and lifelong passion for improving the game through innovation. My primary interests lie in baseball strategy, including run creation, run prevention, and player personnel decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from Ohio University in 2022 with a 4.0 GPA, majoring in Computer Science Engineering. During that time, I also played collegiate baseball for one of the nation’s top NCBA programs, making starts in center field, shortstop, and on the mound. In parallel, I have spent several years training and coaching at Strike Zone, an indoor baseball facility operated by former MLB shortstop Carlos Rodriguez. Through that experience, I developed a strong foundation in player development, practice design, and video-based instruction.

      <p>
        Professionally, I currently work as a Software Site Reliability Engineer at Highmark Health, where I design and maintain large-scale systems supporting enterprise reliability and performance. My role requires analytical problem-solving, pattern recognition, and the development of tools and visual models that support high-stakes decision-making. These experiences have strengthened my skills in analytics, software design, and applied problem-solving capabilities. I am eager to bring this skill set into a baseball operations and player development environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically, I am highly proficient in Python, SQL, R, C++, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, with extensive experience in data visualization and performance analysis. I also have hands-on experience applying machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering, network centrality, and anomaly detection. Just as importantly, I bring a coach’s mindset, an engineer’s discipline, and a deep respect for the game—focused on helping players and staff make better, data-informed decisions.
